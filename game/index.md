# TJ227 Game idea

The overall idea is to make a narrative-based RPG with TF and lewd elements. The closest game I can relate to this is Corruption of Champions. You explore locations, get random encounters, sometimes get battles, and of course get TFs and lewds from battle results.

## Setting

Space! So, humanity has expanded out into space. They discovered a mysterious nebula that exhibited many peculiar observations around this nebula. To study the nebula long-term, `CORP_NAME` set up a space colony just outside the nebula. 4 years after the colony was established and populated, regular contact was lost in with it. Deep-space scans have shown that the colony is still present and inhabited. So they've decided to send you off to investigate on your own. Your goal is assess the situation, update `CORP_NAME`, assist the colonists if possible, or destroy the colony if it deemed a threat.

## What's happened there

During the game intro, the player will discover that the colony's interior has changed itself a strange mix of biomes. From jungle, to medieval village, to grungy 21st century town. The inhabitants have all been changed into various forms of "monster" girls. Catgirls, bunnygirls, succubi, you name it! Probably include some guys too. Each different species has formed their own faction and are softly competing for control over the colony, trying to become the dominant species there.

### The Colony

The colony is a fully enclosed [O'Neill Cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder) (similar to Gundam, Babylon 5). Probably about 4km in total length. Originally designed to be totally self-sustaining for 50 years. There's no sun in the area, so the colony has to produce its own sunlight internally. The environment, buildings, plant-life, etc. are all constructed via an intricate network of drones and matter manipulators. Basically, a drone can float in and use beams to deconstruct or construct anything non-organic, to a certain degree.

## Combat

The tech on the colony prevents any sort of lethal weapons from being created or used. The colony's management AI will detect and evaluate and use emergency manipulators to freeze weapons in place and deconstruct them before they can cause any harm. This can be bypassed in certain situations, but not in the typical combat.
To work around this, they created different forms of magical weapons that do not cause physical damage.

### Magical weapons

Weapons will be a conjured item, available in different classes such as sword, polearm, bow, musket, and so forth. Conjuring a weapon requires two things: Training in that class of weapon, and a catalyst item. Catalysts will be regularly available in shops and have different stat tiers, like most RPGs.

- Sword & Shield: Balanced weapon, increases defense, shortest range
- Two-handed sword: Heavy damage, slower attack, short range
- Polearm: Decent damage, slow attack, medium range
- Bow: Low damage, medium attack, longer range
- Musket (Pistol?): Heaviest damage, very slow attack, low accuracy, long range

#### Questions

1. How should range/distance be a direct stat/concept? Skills/Agility to keep an enemy at a distance? If not, how do ranged weapons balance against melee weapons?

### Damage

Instead of classic HP, characters will have SP, Shield Points. This is the strength of the magical shield that they project around themselves. When a character runs out of SP and is hit again, the conjured weapon saps their willpower until they have a chance to recover. Probably about 5-10 minutes of game time passed. This gives the victor enough time to play with the loser. Such as TF them, force mental suggestions, maybe some oral stuff.
