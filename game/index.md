# TJ227 Game idea

The overall idea is to make a narrative-based RPG with TF and lewd elements. The closest game I can relate to this is Corruption of Champions. You explore locations, get random encounters, sometimes get battles, and of course get TFs and lewds from battle results.

## Setting

Space! So, humanity has expanded out into space. They discovered a mysterious nebula that exhibited many peculiar observations around this nebula. To study the nebula long-term, `CORP_NAME` set up a space colony just outside the nebula. 4 years after the colony was established and populated, regular contact was lost in with it. Deep-space scans have shown that the colony is still present and inhabited. So they've decided to send you off to investigate on your own. Your goal is assess the situation, update `CORP_NAME`, assist the colonists if possible, or destroy the colony if it deemed a threat.
